Three R folders: (1) Study1Singlestage, (2) Study2Multistage, correspond to Study 1 (Simulation 3.1) and Study 2 (Simulation 3.2) in the paper. (3) function contains  key funcitons in the project. 

For single-stage decision settings, in Study 1, which is illustrated as Simulation 3.1 in the paper, we consider four different scenarios to verify the double robustness property of our method.

For multi-stage decision settings, we aim to illustrate our estimation of a two-stage treatment decision problem with ordinal outcomes under household interference.
